      <description>&lt;p&gt;Halo !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my first days on the road.&lt;br /&gt;
I spent three nights in Munich, the first two one as a &lt;strong&gt;couch surfer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
And that&amp;rsquo;s what I want to talk about, because yeah, there is nothing much to
say about sightseeing, and if you want to know which buildings you can find in
Munich, just look at the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, couchsurfing !&lt;br /&gt;
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know the principle, it&amp;rsquo;s quite simple :&lt;br /&gt;
People all around the world are gratefully lending their couch, carpet or
flooring, expecting nothing but experience sharing and good stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept surely existed way before couch was invented, but with modernity,
the web platform &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.couchsurfing.com/&#34;&gt;Couchsurfing&lt;/a&gt; has become
widely used by travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s how I ended up at Johannes, a German guy living in a small town near
Munich.&lt;br /&gt;
And it turns out that he was actually hosting six people this night, as many
as his small room could contain.&lt;br /&gt;
So, in the small room of ours there was :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Canadian&lt;/strong&gt; girl, accompanying her guitar around Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two guys from &lt;strong&gt;Bosnia&lt;/strong&gt;, who where drinking coffee all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A girl from &lt;strong&gt;Argentina&lt;/strong&gt;, travelling in Europe after finishing her studies, like
me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Mexican guy&lt;/strong&gt;, who was in a romantic quest to reconquer his &lt;strong&gt;German&lt;/strong&gt;
girlfriend. First time I have seen someone so happy about being able to drink
his beer in the street&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And of course our wonderful guest and his &lt;strong&gt;Spanish&lt;/strong&gt; girlfriend !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I already did a few Couchsurfing some time ago, but it&amp;rsquo;s always a complete
different experience and this one was really great. Hope the other ones will be
as good !&lt;/p&gt;

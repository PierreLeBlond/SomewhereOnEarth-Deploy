      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bratislava is one hour from Vienna, so it was the perfect time to try
hitchicking.&lt;br /&gt;
I thing I&amp;rsquo;ve always been afraid of getting stuck somewere in the
middle of a foreign country, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I only used buses so far, but now
is the time to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;v never done hitchhicking before, and didn&amp;rsquo;t knew were to start. Fortunatly,
we live in a great century and the World Wild Web has an answer for you.&lt;br /&gt;
A few researches, and I found the &lt;a href=&#34;http://hitchwiki.org/en/Main_Page&#34;&gt;golden mine&lt;/a&gt;.
As a wiki, many places are very well documented and you&amp;rsquo;re able to know exactly
were to stand or ask for drivers depending on were you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to be in Bratislava in the evening, and I start walking to the
right hitchhicking spot around noon. I didn&amp;rsquo;t knew how many time it would take to
find a car heading to Bratislava, so I give myself plenty of time.&lt;br /&gt;
The spot was a petrol station. Once there, I saw a Slovakian car plate, I
waited for the owner to go out of the store and I simply asked if he was
going to Bratislava and if he could take me there. And he did. One hour latter
I was in Bratislava.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Way too easy&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Actually, it was the first time this driver took someone hitchhicking.&lt;br /&gt;
So, thumbs up, and don&amp;rsquo;t panic !&lt;/p&gt;
